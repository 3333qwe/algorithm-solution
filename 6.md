## 6.1
Using dynamic programming, we can solve the problem in linear time.

We consider a linear number of subproblems, each of which can be solved using previously solved subproblems in constant time, this giving a running time of O(n).

Let S[k] denote the sum of a maximum sum contiguous subsequence ending exactly at index k.

Thus, we have that:

S[k+1] = max \{S[k] + A[k+1], A[k+1] \} (for all 1 \leq k \leq n-1)

Also, S[0] = A[0].

——–

Using the above recurrence relation, we can compute the sum of the optimal subsequence for array A, which would just be the maximum over S[i] for 0 \leq i \leq n-1.

Since we are required to output the starting and ending indices of an optimal subsequence, we would use another array T where T[i] would store the starting index for a maximum sum contiguous subsequence ending at index i.

In prseducode form, the algorithm would look thus:

Create arrays S and T each of size n.

### What is the annotation of T(i,j) or T(i)
- T(i) is whether the 1~n is a valid word list.
- preview(i)=j is the last word if T(i) is valid so that we can split track T(j)(previous words) and x(j+1 to i) (last word)

We want find T(n) and preview(n) to trace back


### What is sub problem

base cases:

T(0) = true

T(i) = OR among all (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i))

where i in `[0,n]` and j in `[0,i]`

### What is algorithm
```
T(0) = 0

for i in 1..n:
  for j in 0.. i:
    if (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i) == true):
      T(i) = true
      preview(i)=j


i=n
list=[]
while i!=0:
  list.add(preview(i)) 
  i = preview(i)

reverse the list

```

### Complexity

O(n^2) + O(n)

so O(n^2)

Problem 6-2.

For each pattern, there are a constant number of patterns that are compatible with it
(for example, every pattern is compatible with the empty pattern). Define &" CD" G
to be the
optimal value achievable by pebbling columns %

OQOQO  " such that the final column has
pattern E
. Then for any E
, &" CD"\#Z% G
is the value of the squares covered by E
in column
"#t% , plus the maximum value of &" CH" G
, subject to E
 being compatible with E
. (This
claim can be proven by a standard “cut-and-paste” argument: if not, then replace the
first " columns with a higher-valued pebbling that still ends in pattern E
 , then pebble
column " # % with pattern E
to get a higher-valued pebbling than the original.) The base
cases are &#" CNMG 02M for all column patterns E
. Furthermore, &'" CH";#]% G
can be computed
in <f	>%6 time by examining the <f	g%? values &" CH" G
and adding the values of the <f	g%?
squares pebbled by E
.
From here, the dynamic programming algorithm is clear: keep 8 separate arrays (one
for each column pattern) of  elements. For "=0 %

OQOSO  , compute &'"/CD" G
for each
of the 8 values of E
as described above. To reconstruct the actual pebbling, find the
maximum value & from &"/CDG
, and pebble the th column according to some E
such
that &K0Z&#"/CHG
. Then subtract the value of the pebbled squares from &, and search for &
among &#"CH 
%
G
, etc. The running time of this algorithm is <f	 because filling each
of the (constant number of) arrays takes <f	 time, and backtracking takes <=	>%? time
per column.
Note that it is not sufficient to keep only the the largest value achievable by pebbling
the first " columns (irrespective of the pattern in its final column). This is because it
might be possible to get very high value from the 	e"\#]%? st column, but only by using
a pattern incompatible with the best pebbling of the first " column
