## 6.4 Dictionary lookup

### what is the annotation of T(i,j) or T(i)
- T(i) is whether the 1~n is a valid word list.
- preview(i)=j is the last word if T(i) is valid so that we can split track T(j)(previous words) and x(j+1 to i) (last word)

We want find T(n) and preview(n) to trace back


### what is sub problem

base cases:

T(0) = true

T(i) = OR among all (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i))

where i in `[0,n]` and j in `[0,i]`

### what is algorithm
```
T(0) = 0

for i in 1..n:
  for j in 0.. i:
    if (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i) == true):
      T(i) = true
      preview(i)=j
      
```
