## 6.4 Dictionary lookup

### what is the annotation of T(i,j) or T(i)
- T(i) is whether the 1~n is a valid word list.
- preview(i)=j is the last word if T(i) is valid so that we can split track T(j)(previous words) and x(j+1 to i) (last word)

We want find T(n) and preview(n) to trace back


### what is sub problem

base cases:

T(0) = true

T(i) = OR among all (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i))

where i in `[0,n]` and j in `[0,i]`

### what is algorithm
```
T(0) = 0

for i in 1..n:
  for j in 0.. i:
    if (T(j) AND dict(j+1,i) == true):
      T(i) = true
      preview(i)=j


i=n
list=[]
while i!=0:
  list.add(preview(i)) 
  i = preview(i)

reverse the list

```

### complexity

O(n^2) + O(n)

so O(n^2)

## 6.8 Longest common substring
Note: [6.11](##6.11 Longest common subsequence)

### what is the annotation of T(i,j) or T(i)
T(i,j) = Longest common substring end with X_i, Y_j

### what is sub problem
T(i,0) = 0
T(0,j) = 0

T(i,j) = T(i-1,j-1)+1 if X_i = Y_j else 0


### what is algorithm

```

for i in 1..n:
    T(i,0) = 0

for j in 1..m:
    T(0,j) = 0

for i in 1..n:
    for j in 1..m:
        T(i,j) = T(i-1,j-1)+1 if X_i = Y_j else 0

```

### complexity

O(mn)

## 6.11 Longest common subsequence
Note: [6.8](## 6.8)

### what is the annotation of T(i,j) or T(i)
T(i,j) = Longest common subsequnence end with X_i, Y_j

### what is sub problem

T(i,0) = 0

T(0,j) = 0

T(i,j) = T(i-1,j-1)+1 if X_i = Y_j else max(T(i-1,j), T(i,j-1))


### what is algorithm


```

for i in 1..n:
    T(i,0) = 0

for j in 1..m:
    T(0,j) = 0

for i in 1..n:
    for j in 1..m:
        if X_i = Y_j:
            T(i,j) = T(i-1,j-1)+1 
        else:
            T(i,j) = max(T(i-1,j), T(i,j-1)) 

```
